# Data sources and AI methods
### Building AI course project
The dataset used in this project is synthetic and consists of cabin attributes such as cabin size, location, number of rooms, and the actual prices. The neural network model utilizes a multi-layer feedforward architecture with ReLU activation for hidden layers and linear activation for the output.

The following methods were used:
- **Neural Networks**: A deep learning approach to model the relationship between cabin attributes and prices.
- **ReLU activation function**: Applied to hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
- **Linear activation function**: Used for the output layer to predict continuous values (price).

## Challenges

This project does not:
* Solve the problem of data collection, as it assumes synthetic data.
* Provide highly accurate predictions without proper data preprocessing or optimization.
* Handle real-world issues like missing or incomplete data, which could affect model performance.

### Ethical considerations:
- Ensuring that the model does not introduce biases based on the cabin features is crucial.
- Data privacy concerns should be taken into account if personal or location data is used in training the model.

## What next?

The project could be expanded by:
* Integrating a more comprehensive and real-world dataset with various cabin attributes.
* Experimenting with different neural network architectures, such as deeper networks or more complex models.
* Implementing techniques like regularization or hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.

Further development could include:
* Deploying the model as a web service to provide real-time predictions to users.
* Gathering real-world feedback to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.
